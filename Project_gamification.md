Gamification builds user engagement. What kind of users do you have? Are they website visitors, customers, students or maybe employees?

Gamification allows you to reward your users, which does a few things for you:
  * Builds loyalty
  * Creates status
  * Provides meaningful feedback
  * Encourages exploration

And what does all that get you? That, my friend, gets you a user that:
  * Is more engaged
  * Comes back more often
  * Spends more time with you
  * Participates more fully
