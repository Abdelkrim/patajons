How

## Four success factors ##
  * A renewed believe in the importance of community
  * A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and realtime technologies
  * Pressing unresolved environmental concerns
  * A global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumers behaviors

## Collaborative consumption is organised into three clear systems ##
  1. Redistribution markets,They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' -- reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute -- because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste
  1. collaborative lifestyles. This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time (competition to Shurgard?)
  1. Product-service systems. This is where you pay for the benefit of the product -- what it does for you -- without needing to own the product outright.
