PALISADES PARK, N.J., May 17 /PRNewswire/ -- SwapVillage announced today
 the launch of its swapping web site for consumers.  The site's address is
 www.swapvillage.com .  Users can list items they have and trade among
 themselves.  Unlike an auction where many traders compete to beat the highest
 bid, SwapVillage members barter with each other to exchange goods.  Recently
 featured items include fish tank, PC, toys, car, Internet domain name, and
 fine jewelry.
     "Swapping has been part of human life.  In fact, that's how all
 transactions were made until very recently.  With the Internet's facilitation,
 we're now reviving the excitement of swapping within our community," said
 Michael Ko, President of SwapVillage.
     In addition to online listing and trading services, SwapVillage offers
 SwapCorner, which is a physical meeting and exchange location for in-person
 swapping.  SwapCorner locations are sponsored by local retail stores in
 traders' neighborhood.  Traders can exchange items in person at safe public
 places without hassles of shipping.  SwapVillage currently has several
 SwapCorner locations throughout New York City.  Other cities will soon follow.
     SwapVillage also allows individual customers to organize their own
 SwapClub with fellow enthusiasts, friends, family, or other traders who share
 similar interests.
     "The Internet is great in its global reach but we believe that grouping
 people together who have common bonding and interest is a great way for the
 best swapping experience," Mr. Ko continues.  "SwapClub allows users to form
 their own club so that club members can swap items within their own community.
 For example, one lady is forming a club with her friends at work to exchange
 baby items and toys.  It's a wonderful way of sharing things with people you
 know and trust."
     Joining SwapVillage is free.  There are currently no listings,
 transactions, or membership fees at this time.
